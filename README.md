# Hungry Strawberry Game

A simple game built in HTML5 with Svelte and TypeScript.

Almost entirely vibe-coded with Gemini 3 Flash, for better or for worse. Game development is not my expertise and I wanted to see how far I could get with prompts. As it turns out: pretty far.

## Quick start ✅

- Install dependencies and start dev server:

	yarn
	yarn dev

- Build for production and preview:

	yarn build
	yarn preview

- Production files are emitted to `dist/` (includes `index.html` and assets under `dist/assets/`).

You can also use the npm equivalents: `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`.
